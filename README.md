# DeepRUL

This repository contains a set of Python notebooks for eXplainable Deep Learning applications in Remaining Useful Life and Machine's health Estimation.

## Phase 1 - Predictive maintenance

TODO: what is predictive maintenance, its tasks ...
Road map of this hase : We choose a dataset, explore and show two tasks (health state, classification and TTF, Regression)
We then choose a baseline model for each task and compare it with Our developed NN approach
Furthermore, we ry to explain the decision of out model.
